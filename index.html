    <h1>Sample </h1>

    <p>With WSL, you can install and run Linux distributions on Windows. This enables you to develop and test your source code on Linux while still working locally on your Windows machine.

        When coupled with the Remote - WSL extension, you get full VS Code editing and debugging support while running in the context of WSL.
        
        See the Developing in WSL documentation to learn more or try the Working in WSL introductory tutorial.

        Common questions#
        What command-line arguments are supported by the Windows Setup?#
        VS Code uses Inno Setup to create its setup package for Windows. Thus, all the Inno Setup command-line switches are available for use.
        
        Additionally, you can prevent the Setup from launching VS Code after completion with /mergetasks=!runcode.
        
        Scrolling is laggy and not smooth#
        On certain devices, editor scrolling is not smooth but laggy for an unpleasant experience. If you notice this issue, make sure you install the Windows 10 October 2018 update where this issue is fixed.
        
        I'm having trouble with the installer#
        Try using the zip file instead of the installer. To use this, unzip VS Code in your AppData\Local\Programs folder.
        
        Note: When VS Code is installed via a Zip file, you will need to manually update it for each release.
        
        Icons are missing#
        I installed Visual Studio Code on my Windows 7 or 8 machine. Why are some icons not appearing in the workbench and editor?
        
        VS Code uses SVG icons and we have found instances where the .SVG file extension is associated with something other than image/svg+xml. We're considering options to fix it, but for now here's a workaround:</p>
